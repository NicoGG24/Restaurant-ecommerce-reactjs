# Restaurant Ecommerce React js

This is a Restaurant-themed project. It reflects most of the things I learned during my React js course at Coderhouse.
The project was made as an SPA (Single page application) using react-router-dom.

## Deployment
  
  In order to run this project, you'll need to run the following commands: 
  
  * "npm install" and wait while the modules download before running the next one.
  * "npm start" and wait for the project to start in your browser.
  
## Styling

To style it, it was used Tailwind CSS (learn more at: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app). The app is fully responsive since it was created for mobile first and then adapted to bigger screens.

## Database
The database was made using Firebase (learn more at: https://firebase.google.com/?hl=es). It was the database necessary to make this project according to the requirments given by Coderhouse to this project.
In that database we store all the sales and items used in the app under the names of "products" and "sales".
